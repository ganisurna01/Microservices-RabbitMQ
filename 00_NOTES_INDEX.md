## Services at a Glance

| Service | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Auth** | Signup, signin, JWT cookie. No RabbitMQ. |
| **Tickets** | Owns tickets. Publishes ticket.*. Consumes order.created, order.cancelled. |
| **Orders** | Owns orders. Publishes order.*. Consumes ticket.*, payment.*, expiration.expired. |
| **Payments** | Stripe. Publishes payment.*. Consumes order.*. |
| **Expiration** | Schedules order expiry. Consumes order.created. Publishes expiration.expired (delayed). |
| **Client** | Next.js frontend. Calls APIs via `ticketing.dev`. |

## Core Flow: Order → Pay → Complete

1. **Order** → Orders publishes `order.created` → Tickets reserves ticket and publishes `ticket.updated` → Orders updates its local ticket copy. Payments stores order. Expiration schedules 2‑min timer.
2. **Pay** → User hits Payments API → `payment.created` → Orders sets `pending_payment` → `order.pending` → Payments updates.
3. **Complete** → Stripe webhook → `payment.succeeded` → Orders sets `completed`.
4. **Expire** → After 2 min → `expiration.expired` → Orders cancels → `order.cancelled` → Tickets releases ticket.

## Data Flow Between Services

```
Tickets (owner)  ──ticket.*──►  Orders (copy)
Orders (owner)   ──order.*──►   Tickets, Payments, Expiration
Payments         ──payment.*──► Orders
Expiration       ──expiration.expired──► Orders
```
